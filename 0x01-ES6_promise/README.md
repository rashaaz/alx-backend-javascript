## Overview

This project focuses on ES6 Promises in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and handle promises, utilize async/await, and manage errors using try/catch. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the concepts and usage of promises and async functions in JavaScript without external references.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what Promises are and why they are used.
- Use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods.
- Utilize every method of the Promise object.
- Implement `try` and `catch` for error handling.
- Use the `await` operator.
- Write asynchronous functions with `async`.
